# Supplementary material for "Reversible designs for extreme memory cost reduction of CNN training"

This repository provides code to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper "Reversible designs for extreme memory cost reduction of CNN training".


# Installation
### Important
This repo requires Pytorch 0.4.
It can not work with Pytorch >= 1.0 as these versions have forbidden access to some of the internal tensors.
